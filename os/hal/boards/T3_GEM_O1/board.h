 * Memory map as seen by the MCU_R5FSS0 core 0, see
 * cslr_mcu_r5fss0_baseaddress.h in the TI MCU+ SDK.
 *
 * Only one TCM is usable on this core. The Linux device tree gives it
 * ti,loczrama = <0>, which puts the BTCM at address 0 and the ATCM at
 * 0x41010000, and then ti,atcm-enable = <0> leaves the ATCM switched off.
 * Address 0 is not negotiable: Cortex-R5 has no VBAR, so the vectors, the
 * pre-MPU boot code and the banked mode stacks all share this 32K block.
 * The Main domain core has the opposite layout (loczrama = 1, both TCMs
 * enabled), which is why the linker script differs from the Main build.

 * MAILBOX0 cluster 1 (MAILBOX0_REGS1), the A53 <-> MCU_R5F doorbell.
 *
 * This is the channel the Linux k3_r5_remoteproc driver uses to ask the R5F to
 * shut down: `mboxes = <0x11 0x12>` on the r5f@79000000 node resolves to
 * mailbox@29010000 / chan mbox-mcu-r5-0. Without a handler on this side,
 * `remoteproc stop` blocks ~25 s and fails with -EBUSY
 * ("k3_r5_rproc_stop: timeout waiting for rproc completion event"), which is
 * why loading new firmware needed a full power cycle.
 *
 * FIFO direction is stated from LINUX's point of view in the device tree, so it
 * inverts here: DT `ti,mbox-tx = <1 0 0>` means Linux transmits on FIFO 1, so
 * the R5F RECEIVES on FIFO 1; DT `ti,mbox-rx = <0 0 0>` means the R5F
 * TRANSMITS on FIFO 0. Getting this backwards yields a mailbox that never
 * interrupts, which looks exactly like having no driver at all.
 *
 * The user index is not discoverable from the device tree -- Linux only
 * declares its own (0). From the J722S TRM Table 4-138:
 *   ..._CLUSTER_1_mailbox_cluster_pend_0 -> GICSS0_spi_109              (Linux, user 0)
 *   ..._CLUSTER_1_mailbox_cluster_pend_2 -> MCU_R5FSS0_CORE0_cpu0_intr_241  (us, user 2)
 *   ..._CLUSTER_1_mailbox_cluster_pend_3 -> WKUP_R5FSS0_CORE0_intr_241
 * Cross-checked two ways: the DT parent interrupt <0 0x4d 4> is GIC SPI 77,
 * and 77 + 32 = INTID 109 = the TRM's GICSS0_spi_109, which confirms
 * pend_N <-> user N; and the TRM's MCU_TIMER0 -> cpu0_intr_28 matches
 * AM67_TIMER0_IRQ above, which is hardware-verified, confirming that
 * cpu0_intr_N is the VIM input number.

 * k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm0-gpio5.dtbo). The DT owns pinmux + the module
 * clock/power; the firmware only drives EPWM registers.
 *
 * The EPWM counter input clock (SYSCLKOUT) is the clock BEFORE the TBCTL
 * HSPCLKDIV/CLKDIV prescale, i.e. the module "fck": confirmed 250 MHz on this
 * board via /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary and the Linux pwm-tiehrpwm
 * driver (it derives period/duty from clk_get_rate of "fck"). The separate
 * epwm_tbclk gate must be enabled for the counter to run but is NOT a
 * divider. The value itself lives in am67_registry.h as AM67_EPWM_CLOCK.

 * EPWM1 (eHRPWM) second instance: EHRPWM1_A -> GPIO6 (pin 31), EHRPWM1_B ->
 * GPIO13 (pin 33). Same IP and 250 MHz fck as EPWM0; A and B share the time
 * base but have independent CMPA/CMPB compares.
 *
 * ECAP0/1/2 (eCAP in APWM mode) -> GPIO12 (pin 32) / GPIO16 (pin 36) /
 * GPIO18 (pin 12). Separate IP from EHRPWM. The APWM counter (TSCTR) is 32-bit
 * and clocked directly by the module fck, so no prescale is used.
 * That fck is 125 MHz on this board -- HALF the EPWM fck (a different clock
 * domain), verified via /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary
 * (23100000/23110000/23120000.pwm fck = 125000000) and confirmed by scope
 * (50 Hz with period = 2500000 ticks). All three ECAP instances share it.
 *
 * EHRPWM0_B -> GPIO14 (pin 8). Freed 2026-08-03: this pad was the UART1
 * console TX until MAVLink moved to the shared-memory rings (DR-016) and the
 * stock overlay k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm0-gpio5-gpio14.dtbo reconfigured
 * main_uart1 to an RX-only pin group (pad 0x01AC, pin 10) while taking pad
 * 0x01B0 for EHRPWM0_B. The four flight outputs are now EHRPWM0_A/B and
 * EHRPWM1_A/B; the ECAP bases below are retained but no longer driven by
 * AP_HAL_ChibiOS_K3::RCOutput.
