/**
 * @file    board.c
 * @brief   T3 Gemstone O1 (AM67A/J722S) R5F early initialization.
 * @details MPU region layout mirrors the proven NuttX am67 port, with one
 *          additional non-cacheable window covering the RemoteProc resource
 *          table and trace buffer so that the Linux host always sees fresh
 *          data once the D-cache gets enabled.
 *
 *          MPU region priority grows with the region number, later regions
 *          override earlier ones on overlap.

    Data cache on.

    Safe only because mpu_init() above already puts every window shared with
    Linux into region 4 as NORMAL_NONCACHE: the resource table (0xA1100000),
    the RemoteProc trace buffer (0xA1110000, including the fault block at
    0xA1113F20) and the IPC window (0xA1120000, carrying both the MAVLink
    rings and the 16 KiB parameter-storage image). Region 4 spans
    0xA1100000..0xA1200000 while code, data and heap start at 0xA1240000, so
    nothing cacheable overlaps anything the host reads. That is why
    ipc_ring.c and ipc_storage.c need only a DMB and no cache maintenance.

    Until 2026-08-02 this bit was left clear "for bring-up", so every data
    access ran at DDR latency. Cost measured before enabling it: the IMU
    delivered 86 Hz against a configured 100 Hz, the main loop could not hold
    50 Hz, and EKF3 added ~6 ms per iteration -- enough to starve telemetry
    until QGC dropped the link.

    If anything shared with Linux ever starts reading stale -- trace output
    freezing, QGC losing the link, parameters not persisting -- suspect a new
    allocation placed outside region 4 before suspecting this line.
