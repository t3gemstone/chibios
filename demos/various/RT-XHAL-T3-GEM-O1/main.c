 *     drained, which the THRE interrupt alone cannot report.
 *   - the second pass reads while the frames are still on the wire, so the
 *     receiver interrupt and the character timeout are what release it, and
 *     the tail of the pattern is shorter than the FIFO trigger level.
 *
 * The test requires the UART to belong to this firmware alone. A host OS
 * holding the same port, which on a K3 device means a driver bound to it in
 * the device tree, services the same interrupt: reading IIR from that side
 * consumes the character timeout and reading RBR consumes the frames, and
 * this test then fails at "rx-sync" with frames missing. Reserve the port
 * for the firmware before drawing conclusions about the driver.
